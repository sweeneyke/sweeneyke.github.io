Hello, my name is Katherine Sweeney, but I go by Kat. I am in my third year pursuing a Computer Science degree with a minor in Data Science. I am originally from New Hampshire, and moved to South Carolina for college. I knew that I wanted to go into Computer Science even before I went into high school. I'm excited to get into the field, and start working.
