 Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of system components?


It is impossible to infer the emergency properties of a complex system from the properties of system components because the emergent properties are not characteristics of the system components, but rather characteristics of the system. This is because the emergent properties *emerge* from the system. A complex system has many interwoven interactions, it's difficult to predict the result of these interactions, thus, the emergent properties cannot be inferred just from the components.
