**Reflections on Fantastic Four Progress**

Since the beginning of the project, I feel that my team has been adequately communicative and punctual. We have had our respective responsibilities and we have succeeded in living up to them. My team has been able to effectively collaborate, meet deadlines or brain storm ideas.

We have not had any issues with time management, or cutting deadlines close. Ultimately, I could not ask for a more collaborative, and effective team.
