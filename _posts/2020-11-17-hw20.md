After presenting Deliverable 3, our team had things to fix and simplify. All of the issues were very simple to fix,
within less than a week our project was ready for Deliverable 4, as we were able to implement the remaining test cases
incredibly easily. Due to consistent communication we are able to work together to resolve problems that arose in the process of
completing this project. It is great to work with such proactive, responsive people.

All of us have stepped up as members of the team to get things done for the project, and everything has been done incredibly early.
We're already thinking about Deliverable 5. Ultimately, progress has been consistent and excellent, and team communication has been great.
