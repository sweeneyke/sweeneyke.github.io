**23.6**


This graph represents the task durations for software project activities.
From the graph, it can be gathered that there are three tasks that have no dependencies and can begin immediately

T1, T4, and T5 do not have any dependencies

Whereas,
T2 cannot start until T1 is complete, thus T2 has a dependency on T1,
T3 cannot begin until T2 is done, etc.

If T5 takes takes 40 days instead of 10 days, it would not affect the overall outcome of the project in terms of task completion time (ie. no regard for resource cost).

This is because T5 is a direct dependent: T10 is dependent on the completion of T5 and T9.
As well as an indirect dependent: T12 is dependent on T10, T15 is dependent on T12 and T14

The time that T9 takes to complete is 65 days regardless of whether or not T5 takes 10 days or 40 days. This is because
the amount of days that T10 cannot start is bounded by the amount of days the more time consuming dependency takes. Since tasks with no dependencies can all be started simultaneously, the delay of the completion of T5 won't affect T10 until it takes longer than T9 to complete. Thus, the project doesn't need to be reorganized just yet. As long as the independent tasks are started concurrently at the beginning of the project, the project ultimately won't face risk of delays.
