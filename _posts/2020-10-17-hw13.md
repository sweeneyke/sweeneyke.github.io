***17.10***


Since the company is moving from a localized host where each user has their isolated application, to an environment where the user is using the same application as others simultaneously, there needs to be some type of way to distinguish between the various users, in terms of how they are interacting with the application. They cannot all be interacting with the same ‘version’ of the application because how the user interacts with the application may affect how the application exists to another user. Thus, there needs to be a separation for each user in such a way that the application is more of a projection of itself, and presents itself to the user in a way that the user maintains their own information specific to the application. Like implementing a log in feature which creates a user, and a user’s respective database.



One of the major risks that the company will need to address when making the conversion, is data transfer. Depending on what the service is providing, the data transfer of certain entities takes longer than others so this needs to be addressed with the server provider. Additionally, the service is going to be at the mercy of the provider, and the provider can choose to shut down, or faults can occur with the provider that can affect the service.
